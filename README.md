# Jason
CV
Hello my name is Jason, I am a quick learner and am constantly learning new skills; my hobbies include online gaming, movies, TV and my music studio which is ever expanding, and cooking. I pride myself on an excellent communication and organizational skills, I do love to be busy. I am honest, loyal, punctual, hard working and self motivated and above all enthusiastic about everything. I also have a very dry wit and fabulous sense of humour. I have more bounce back than a bouncy castle, I am not easy discouraged, and never afraid to ask for help. In fact I am usually the person people come to with the sentence “Your clever Jason aren't you?” So I respond “OK what is it you can not do?” I catch on to things quite quick. Even from the first PC the ZX 81 I have been loving the whole computer revolution. My computer is now second nature to me, Windows 12 coming soon. I can even type in the dark at a rate of knots.. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me on Mobile: 07396 544484 or T: 01512871252.
I hope to hear from you soon!
